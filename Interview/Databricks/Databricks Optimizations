Create partitions on every table and for fact tables use partition column on key join column like country_code, city, market_code

Land data in Blob Store/ADLS partitioned into separate directory

delta.autoOptimize.autoCompact = true

Use Repartition hints for balancing partitions

Delete temporary tables after notebook execution

Use Lower() or Upper() when comparing strings or common filter conditions to avoid losing data
