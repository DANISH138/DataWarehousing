🎃 Write a SQL query to get the number of days between first and last purchase of each customer from table emp.
(Columns: ustomer_id and purchase_date)

🎁 SQL code:

SELECT
customer_id,
DATEDIFF(MAX(purchase_date), MIN(purchase_date)) AS days_between_purchases
FROM
emp
GROUP BY customer_id;


🎈 MAX(purchase_date) retrieves the latest purchase date for each customer.
🎈 MIN(purchase_date) retrieves the earliest purchase date for each customer.
🎈 DATEDIFF() calculates the difference in days between the latest and earliest purchase dates.
🎈 GROUP BY customer_id groups the results by customer, 
so you get the number of days between the first and last purchase for each customer.
