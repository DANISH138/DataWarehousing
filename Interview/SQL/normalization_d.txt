Normalization vs. Denormalization

Normalization is the technique of dividing the data into multiple tables to reduce data redundancy and inconsistency
and to achieve data integrity. 

On the other hand, Denormalization is the technique of combining the data into a single table to make data retrieval faster.

Normalization is used in an OLTP system, which emphasizes making the insert, delete and update anomalies faster.
As the opposite, Denormalization is used in an OLAP system, which emphasizes making the search and analysis faster.

Data integrity is maintained in the normalization process while in denormalization data integrity harder to retain.

Redundant data is eliminated when normalization is performed whereas denormalization increases the redundant data.

Normalization increases the number of tables and joins. In contrast, denormalization reduces the number of tables and joins.

Disk space is wasted in denormalization because the same data is stored in different places. On the contrary, disk space is 
optimized in a normalized table.

Conclusion
Normalization and denormalization are useful according to the situation. Normalization is used when the faster
insertion, deletion and update anomalies, and data consistency are necessarily required. On the other hand, 
Denormalization is used when the faster search is more important and to optimize the read performance. 
It also lessens the overheads created by over-normalized data or complicated table joins.
