🔴 𝐋𝐚𝐤𝐞𝐡𝐨𝐮𝐬𝐞 𝐀𝐫𝐜𝐡𝐢𝐭𝐞𝐜𝐭𝐮𝐫𝐞

Lakehouse intents us to provide the features of both 𝐃𝐚𝐭𝐚 𝐋𝐚𝐤𝐞 and Data Warehouse.


Some of the benefits of 𝐃𝐚𝐭𝐚 𝐋𝐚𝐤𝐞 are
🔺They are Inexpensive.
🔺They are massively scalable
🔺They can store all kinds of data like structured,semi-structured,unstructured.
🔺Datalakes support open file formats like parquet.

We face some challenges with 𝐃𝐚𝐭𝐚𝐋𝐚𝐤𝐞
🔺They don't support ACID Properties
🔺They are not suitable for BI & Reporting Workloads

In an organization to serve all the usecases they use to have combination of 𝐃𝐚𝐭𝐚 𝐋𝐚𝐤𝐞 and 𝐃𝐚𝐭𝐚 𝐖𝐚𝐫𝐞𝐡𝐨𝐮𝐬𝐞

𝐃𝐚𝐭𝐚 𝐋𝐚𝐤𝐞 use to server Machine Learning and Data Science Usecases.Some part of this data use to go to 𝐃𝐚𝐭𝐚 𝐖𝐚𝐫𝐞𝐡𝐨𝐮𝐬𝐞 which use to serve the reporting and BI usecases.

So we use to have 2 different systems.This 2 Tier Architecture is called as 𝐌𝐨𝐝𝐞𝐫𝐧 𝐃𝐚𝐭𝐚𝐰𝐚𝐫𝐞𝐡𝐨𝐮𝐬𝐞 𝐀𝐫𝐜𝐡𝐢𝐭𝐞𝐜𝐭𝐮𝐫𝐞.

Now there are some challenges with this Modern 𝐃𝐚𝐭𝐚𝐖𝐚𝐫𝐞𝐡𝐨𝐮𝐬𝐞 Architecture like
🔺We deal with 2 different systems(Data Lake and Data warehouse)
🔺We have data duplication issues
🔺When moving data from Datalake to Datawarehouse it needs additional ETL Activities.
🔺In Datawarehouse we'll get stale data in the sense not the latest data

So nowadays Organization use Lakehouse Architecture which gives us a Single system with features of both Data Lake and Datawarehouse

🔴𝐎𝐛𝐣𝐞𝐜𝐭𝐢𝐯𝐞𝐬 𝐨𝐟 𝐋𝐚𝐤𝐞𝐡𝐨𝐮𝐬𝐞 𝐀𝐫𝐜𝐡𝐢𝐭𝐞𝐜𝐭𝐮𝐫𝐞:
🔺It should be Inexpensive
🔺It should be able to handle all kinds of data
🔺Should support open file formats
🔺Data duplication should be reduced
🔺ETL Activities should be reduced
🔺Mainly it should be able to handle all kinds of workloads like Machine learning,Data science,Business Intelligence,Reporting Usecases.
