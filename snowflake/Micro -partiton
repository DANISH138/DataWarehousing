Snowflake stores metadata about the rows in each micro-partition

• Range of values for each column
• Number of distinct values
• Other properties allowing query optimization


Advantages of Micro-partitions:
Automated partitioning - no user involvement in creating and managing partitions

Small size allows for efficient query pruning

Columnar storage within partitions, only columns referenced by a query are scanned

Data stored in an efficient, compressed format
