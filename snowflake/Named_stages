Named Stages
Named stages are database objects that provide the greatest degree of flexibility for data loading:

Users with the appropriate privileges on the stage can load data into any table.

Because the stage is a database object, the security/access rules that apply to all objects apply. 
The privileges to use a stage can be granted or revoked from roles. In addition, ownership of the stage can be transferred to another role.

If you plan to stage data files that will be loaded only by you, or will be loaded only into a single table,
then you may prefer to simply use either your user stage or the stage for the table into which you will be loading data.
Named stages are optional but recommended when you plan regular data loads that could involve multiple users and/or table
