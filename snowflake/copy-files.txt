**Usage notes
This command does not support the following:
1.Copying files from or to user or table stages.

2.Copying files that are larger than 5GB.


**Considerations for running this command:

COPY FILES statements overwrite any existing files with matching names in the target location. 
The command does not remove any existing files that don’t match the names of the copied files.

If a file copy operation fails, Snowflake does not perform any automatic cleanup.


**The COPY FILES command incurs data transfer and compute costs:

Data transfer: Snowflake charges a per-byte fee when you copy files from an internal Snowflake stage
into an external stage in a different region or with a different cloud provider.
Snowflake does not charge for data ingress (for example, when copying files from an external stage into an internal stage).


Compute: COPY FILES is a serverless feature and doesn’t require a virtual warehouse.
The line item for the COPY FILES command on your Snowflake bill does not include any cloud services charges.
