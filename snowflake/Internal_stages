Snowfalke Supports 3 type of internal stages-
1.User
2.Table
3.Named

1.User
A user stage can't be created or dropped. 
They are automatically created and available for a user lifetime. 
They can be referenced using @~syntax.
User stages don't support file format options. The COPY command must 
include these arguments.


2.Table
A table stage can't be created or dropped. 
They are automatically created and available for a table's lifetime.
Multiple users can assess table stage but it can only load data into one table.
They share the table's name and can be referenced using @%tablename syntax.
Table stages don't support file format options. The COPY command must include these arguments.
Table stages don't allow data transformations while loading the data.



3.Named Stages

A named internal stage is a database objects that can be created, modified and dropped.
Compared to a table or a user stage they are more flexible.
They can be shared and can be used to load multiple files and multiple tables.

Named stages are database objects that provide the greatest degree of flexibility for data loading:

Users with the appropriate privileges on the stage can load data into any table.

Because the stage is a database object, the security/access rules that apply to all objects apply. 
The privileges to use a stage can be granted or revoked from roles. In addition, ownership of the stage can be transferred to another role.

If you plan to stage data files that will be loaded only by you, or will be loaded only into a single table,
then you may prefer to simply use either your user stage or the stage for the table into which you will be loading data.
Named stages are optional but recommended when you plan regular data loads that could involve multiple users and/or table
