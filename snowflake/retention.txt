If you change the retention period at the account level, all databases, schemas, and tables
that do not have an explicit retention period automatically inherit the new retention period.

explicit retention settings take precedence over the account-level retention setting. 
So, if you've already set retention periods for databases and tables,
those settings will remain in effect, and they won't be changed by updates to the account-level retention period.
