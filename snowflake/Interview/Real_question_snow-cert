1.what is common between standard warehouse and snowpark optimized warehouse.
2. Snowpark-optimized warehouses---> Workloads that have large memory requirements such as ML training use cases
3. ORGANIZATION ACCOUNTS HISTORY--> list of dropped accounts that have not yet been deleted
4. SPLIT_PART --> If the partNumber is out of range, the returned value is an empty string. 
5.SPLIT_TO_TABLE
6.We can apply a network policy to an account, a security integration, or a user
7.Network policy precedence( 1 question)
8.MONITOR privilege on the warehouse --> Monitoring warehouse load 
9.Access control framework  --> Each object has an owner, who can in turn grant access to that object(DAC)
10. Types of URLs available to access files(2-3 questions)
db,schema and stagename and file URL -->BUILD_STAGE_FILE_URL
Expiration of Pre-signed URL

11.Querying Semi-structured Data[column name is case-insensitive but element names are case-sensitive]
    src:salesperson.name
    SRC:salesperson.name
	
12. The public key is assigned to the Snowflake user who uses the Snowflake client to connect and authenticate to Snowflake.
      ALTER USER example_user SET RSA_PUBLIC_KEY='MIIBIjANBgkqh...';
	  ALTER USER example_user UNSET RSA_PUBLIC_KEY;

12. SELECT PARSE_JSON(NULL) ;-- valid SQL null
13.Stored Procedure--> perform DDL or DML database operations
14. FLATTEN can be used to convert semi-structured data to a relational representation.
15. OBJECT_CONSTRUCT-->Generating a JSON Dataset using Relational Data in Snowflake
