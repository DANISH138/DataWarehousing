Query Result Cache

1. When a query is executed ,  Snowflake cashes the query results for a period.
2. Snowflake uses the query results cache to avoid re-executing queries when there are no data changes.

Query Result Cache is enabled by default.

But it can be turned off at a session level, user level or at the account level.

Using the USE_CACHED_RESULT parameter.

ALTER SESSION SET USE_CACHED_RESULT=FALSE
