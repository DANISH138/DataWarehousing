Q1. Does snowflake enforce primary key?

Ans- The primary key for a foreign key can be on a different table or the same table as the foreign key. 
Snowflake supports defining and maintaining constraints, but does not enforce them, 
except for NOT NULL constraints,which are always enforced.


Q2. Does Snowflake support indexes?
Ans- Snowflake does not support indexes, though it does support "clustering" for performance improvements of I/O.



Q3. Does data in external stage count towards your Snowflake storage?
Ans-
No. External stages point to external cloud storage locations. Data in those external locations are managed and maintained independently and is managed by the respective cloud provider. An external stage only refers to an external location and doesn't physically hold any data.

Q4. The load metadata for a table expires after how many days?
Ans 64 days
